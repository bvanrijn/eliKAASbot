# eliKAASbot
This is eliKAASbot, a multi-purpose bot, like [Mattata (made by Matthew)](https://github.com/matthewhesketh/mattata)

For the cleverbot responses I'm using a libary called [Cleverbot](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cleverbot)

First I used [Clever](http://github.com/bvanrijn/Clever/) but Cleverbot.io always responded with 'False', so I couldn't use it.
